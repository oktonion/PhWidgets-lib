		The Basic superclass provides basic resources for all widgets. It provides the fundamental events for:

		getting/losing focus
		activating
		button press, release, and repeat

		Also, Basic supports:

			toggle buttons
			autohighlighting

		and provides properties for:

			margins
			bevel colors
			outline and inline colors
			draw color
			fill color
			fill pattern.
