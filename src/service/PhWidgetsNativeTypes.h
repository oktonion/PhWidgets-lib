        A pointer to data that you want to pass as the second parameter to the callback function when it's invoked.

    ### Callback functions ###

    A callback function takes the following arguments:

    > PtWidget_t *widget
        A pointer to the widget instance that invoked the callback. 

    > void *client_data
        The data from the PtCallback_t structure.
        @note
        A PhAB callback takes as its second argument a pointer to an ApInfo_t structure. For more information, see the Photon Library Reference.

    > PtCallbackInfo_t *cbinfo
        A pointer to a common Photon callback structure. 
        The structure provides information related to the widget callback being invoked, the Photon event, and some widget-specific callback data. 
        The format of the data varies with the widget class and callback type. 
        For more information, see PtCallbackInfo_t. 

    Callback functions should return `Pt_CONTINUE` unless the description of the widget's callback resource tells you to return something else.

    This structure contains at least: 
    
    ### Members ###
 
    > unsigned short key_sym_cap
        Depending on the specified flags, this member contains either the symbol or cap of the key to be interpreted as a hotkey. For valid key_sym_cap values, see <photon/PkKeyDef.h>. 
    > short flags
        Determines how key_sym_cap is interpreted and whether or not key_mods is used.
    > unsigned long key_mods
        Key modifiers that must be active for the key to be considered a hotkey.
    > PtWidget_t *widget
        If `event_f` is NULL, the widget member's activate callback is invoked with a reason_subtype of `Pt_CB_HOTKEY`. 
        If the `widget` member is NULL when the hotkey is attached, it's set to the widget that the hotkey is attached to. 
    > void *data
        A pointer to any data that you want to pass as the second argument to the callback function. 
    > int (*event_f)( PtWidget_t *, void *, PtCallbackInfo_t * )

        If `event_f` is NULL when the hotkey is activated, 
        the widget that the hotkey is attached to has its PhWidgets::Basic::Activate invoked with a reason_subtype of `Pt_CB_HOTKEY`.

        A PhEventRegion_t structure identifying the region that emitted the event. 
    > PhEventRegion_t collector
        A PhEventRegion_t structure identifying the region that collected the event.

        The number of the input group. A value of 0 means there's no input group. 
    > unsigned short flags
        Event-modifier flags.

    > PhPoint_t translation
        A PhPoint_t structure that specifies the translation between the emitting region's origin and the collecting region's origin. 
        An application uses this member to convert coordinates that are relative to the emitter's region to coordinates that are relative to the collector's region. 
    > unsigned short num_rects
        The number of rectangles associated with the event.
    > unsigned short data_len
        The length of the data associated with the event. Since event data is optional, you can set data_len to 0 when there's no data.
