            The color of each pixel is represented as a 32-bit number: 
            8 bits each for alpha, red, green, and blue (ARGB). 
            Each of the four components is a number from 0 through 255, 
            with 0 representing no intensity and 255 representing full intensity. 
            The alpha component specifies the transparency of the color: 
            0 is fully transparent, and 255 is fully opaque. 
            To determine the alpha, red, green, or blue component of a color, 
            use the Color::A, Color::R, Color::G, or Color::B property, respectively. 
            You can create a custom color by using one of the Color::FromARGB, Color::FromCMY, Color::FromHSV methods.
